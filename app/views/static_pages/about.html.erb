<p>
    <strong>MemoRabble</strong> is a platform for publishing interlinked memos.
</p>
<p>
    Memos are not merely isolated posts that will get lost in a sea of data.
    Your memos can be linked to other memos through <strong>relations</strong>. 
</p>
<p>
    There are no "threads" or subforums. There is not "staying on topic". 
    There are only relations between memos. Conversations are allowed to 
    grow organically and break out into any number of different paths.
